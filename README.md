Aaron Opfer's Looping Music Player
==================================

This is my Web Audio music player that I (plan to) use on my website to
play infinitely looping versions of some of my music.

Hey? Where are the music files?
-------------------------------
Music files are not included as they are more restrictively licensed as
Creative Commons 3.0 BY-NC-SA. That said, I haven't licensed the code
as anything yet either. So if you actually want to use this, ask me to
do so.
